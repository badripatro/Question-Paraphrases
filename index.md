### Motivation
-   We propose a model for obtaining sentence embeddings for solving the paraphrase generation task using a pair-wise discriminator loss added to an encoder-decoder network.
-   We show that these embeddings can also be used for the sentiment analysis task.
-   We validate the model using standard datasets with a detailed comparison with state-of-the-art methods and also ensure that the results are statistically significant.
